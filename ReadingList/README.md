## A Note About Resizing Behavior

Because the project doesn't make use of autolayout and size classes, some components of the user interface may not gracefully handle varying device resolutions, particularly the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

Also, because of an apparent bug in the current iPhone Simulator, I had to configure autoresizing behavior for text fields less than optimally (they don't take full advantage of the increased table view width in landscape mode).
